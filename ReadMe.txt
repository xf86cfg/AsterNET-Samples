About
These samples are provided as is, with no warranty.
Please see the license for this project, provided at: http://asternet-samples.codeplex.com

This is currently still in Alpha, meaning we're still writing the samples and looking for community
feedback on methodology, approach and documentation. Please contribute feedback and issues
via codeplex.

Installation
All the samples provided require AsterNET, http://asternet.codeplex.com
Some of the samples provided require AsterNET.Extensions, http://asternetextensions.codeplex.com

All the required references for AsterNET and AsterNET.Extensions are provided via nuget, so
should automatically import when you build the project.

Please Note
Before running a sample that has an "Audio Prompts" folder, you will need to copy the 
.mp3 files to your asterisk server. If you don't do this, you'll not hear any of the
prompts when played, and will see an error (verbose depending) in the asterisk console.

WINSCP - SSH File Transfer
The best way to copy the files over is by using WinSCP. It's a free application for
windows that allows you to transfer files over SSH.
